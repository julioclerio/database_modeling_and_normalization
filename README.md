# Database Assessment Repository

Welcome to the Database Assessment Repository! This repository is designed to guide you through the process of creating a relational database model for a financial institution and executing various SQL operations using PostgreSQL.

All tasks are implemented in Python scripts using the `pymysql` library. Before running the scripts, ensure you have a relational database set up. If you don't, follow our [Docker Database Setup Guide](#docker-database-setup-guide) below.

### Part 01: Relational Database Modeling

This section focuses on designing a relational database for a financial institution. The scenario revolves around a bank wanting to map its customers to various financial products.

**Tasks**:
- Create a conceptual model based on the initial sketch provided.
- Develop a logical model respecting the first three normal forms.

**Files**:
- `modeling_script.py` (Located in the `Part01` folder)

### Part 02: SQL Queries for PostgreSQL

This section provides SQL queries for a hypothetical e-commerce database.

**Tasks**:
- List products based on price and name.
- Compare product prices against the average.
- Calculate the average price of products for each category.

**Files**:
- `sql_queries_script.py` (Located in the `Part02` folder)

### Part 03: DDL and DML Operations

This section simulates a selection process for a data scientist role, focusing on creating and manipulating tables in PostgreSQL.

**Tasks**:
- Create tables representing a 1,n relationship between `aluno` and `turma`.
- Insert data into these tables.
- Update specific data conditions.

**Files**:
- `ddl_dml_operations_script.py` (Located in the `Part03` folder)
