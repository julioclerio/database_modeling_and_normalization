### Overview

This repository is divided into three main sections:

- **Database Modeling**: Understand the conceptual and logical models for a financial institution.
- **SQL Queries for PostgreSQL**: Learn and execute various SQL queries.
- **DDL and DML Operations**: Dive deep into the creation and manipulation of database tables.

### Database Modeling

We start with a scenario where a financial institution wants to map its customers to various financial products. The initial model consists of two tables: `cliente` and `produto`. The modeling section provides a detailed explanation of the conceptual and logical models, highlighting key attributes, multivalued attributes, and relationship cardinalities.

### SQL Queries for PostgreSQL

This section provides a set of SQL queries for a hypothetical e-commerce database. You'll learn how to:

- List products based on price and name.
- Compare product prices against the average.
- Calculate the average price of products for each category.

### DDL and DML Operations

Experience the process of creating and manipulating tables in PostgreSQL. This section is inspired by a selection process for a data scientist role. You'll learn how to:

- Create tables representing a 1,n relationship between `aluno` and `turma`.
- Insert data into these tables.
- Update data based on specific conditions.
